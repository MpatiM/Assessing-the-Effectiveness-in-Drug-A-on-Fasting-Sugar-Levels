### About
As part of my SAS course curriculum, a study was conducted to determine whether Drug A helps to reduce fasting sugar levels. There are 3400 patients enrolled for this study and the fasting sugar levels were taken before and after consuming Drug A at a certain time interval. The objectives of this project are as follows:
* To identify patients with blood sugar levels between 40 â€“ 600 if there is a difference between before and after taking Drug A in blood sugar levels. If so, was that difference a significant decrease in blood sugar levels?
* Is there a difference in after blood sugar levels between the age groups?
* Similarly, is there is a difference in after blood sugar levels between states?
* Is there an interaction effect for age group and state?
* Is length of stay correlated to initial sugar levels and after sugar levels?

Created and sorted datasets, eliminated extreme values, merged data, and added new data columns. Ran statistical analysis tests and plotted data visualization charts.
